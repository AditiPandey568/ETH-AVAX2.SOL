# Smart Contract and Management


 It includes a frontend interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and a smart contract written in Solidity.

## Description

The project consists of three main components:

1. *HTML*: The HTML file (`index.html`) sets up the structure of the web page. The user interface elements are positioned to provide a clear and intuitive user experience.

2. *JavaScript*: The JavaScript code is contained in the `index.js` file. It handles the interaction with the smart contract and user actions. It includes functions in the HTML file.
3. *Solidity*: The Solidity code is implemented . It defines the smart contract.

### Prerequisites
- MetaMask browser extension

  # Getting started-
  To run the solidity code, you can use gitpot. To get started, go to the gitpot and interact with contract using it.

1)Open the contract file in gitpot.

2)make the files of index.html,index.js and style.css.

3)using different command in terminal execute the fronted 

4)use the exetion Live server by http-server as npm install -g http-server.

5)Running the HTTP Server as http-server

6)Accessing the Application:

After running the HTTP server, you'll see an output like:
Available on:
  http://127.0.0.1:8080
  http://172.17.0.6:8080
  
7)These are URLs where your frontend application is accessible.

On clicking the link starting with http://127.0.0.1:8080 to open your frontend application in a browser tab within Gitpod.
